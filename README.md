## My process

I start trying things out with the knowledge I already posess and then research on the internet or visit past projects when I am stuck.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to implement the margin:auto; property on CSS to center a paragraph and a h1 element horizontally inside a div container.
- It is preferable to use use the margin property instead of the padding property on pictures to which the border-radius property has been applied because with the padding property, the border-radius property is lost on the side(s) of the image to which the padding is applied.
- Relative sizes like percentages are better than absolute sizes for a smoother navigation.
- It is important to set the width and height of the body element in order for the flexbox properties to work properly.
- It is a must to use absolute paths instead of relative paths. If you use relative paths, the links will not work and the layout will not load.

### Continued development

I want to understand the different types of CSS position properties a bit better.
